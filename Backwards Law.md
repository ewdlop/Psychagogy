The concept you're referring to as the "backwards law" is a term popularized by Alan Watts, a British philosopher known for interpreting and popularizing Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. It's a counterintuitive approach to life, closely aligned with some Eastern philosophical principles, particularly those found in Taoism and Buddhism.

Understanding the Backwards Law
The backwards law suggests that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. This idea is encapsulated in one of Watts' famous quotes: "The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."

Key Concepts
Pursuit of Happiness: According to this law, actively and constantly striving for happiness can actually lead to unhappiness. It posits that happiness obtained through direct pursuit is fleeting and unsustainable.

Acceptance of What Is: It encourages acceptance of the current state of things, including negative emotions or situations. By accepting what is, rather than always striving for a different state, one might find a more profound, lasting sense of contentment.

Paradoxical Intention: This is the idea of achieving an outcome by doing the opposite of what is intuitively felt as the right way to achieve it. For example, not caring about a particular outcome might actually increase the likelihood of achieving it.

Letting Go of Attachments: In many Eastern philosophies, attachment is seen as a source of suffering. The backwards law aligns with this idea, suggesting that letting go of intense attachments to goals or desires can lead to a more peaceful and satisfying life.

Application in Daily Life
In practical terms, the backwards law can be applied by:

Focusing on the present moment rather than constantly seeking a better future.
Embracing imperfections and accepting life's challenges.
Letting go of the relentless pursuit of goals and instead finding joy in the journey itself.
Recognizing that some level of discomfort or dissatisfaction is a natural part of life.
It's important to note that this concept doesn't advocate for passivity or giving up on goals and aspirations. Instead, it suggests a shift in perspective â€” finding a balance between effort and acceptance, and recognizing that sometimes, trying too hard can be counterproductive.
