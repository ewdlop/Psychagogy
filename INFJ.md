INFJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This personality type is sometimes referred to as the "Advocate" or "Counselor." People who are identified as INFJ personalities are known for their introverted, intuitive, feeling, and judging traits. Here's a brief overview of the INFJ personality type:

Introverted (I): INFJs tend to be reserved and prefer solitary or small-group activities. They recharge their energy by spending time alone, thinking and reflecting.

Intuitive (N): They rely more on their intuition than on their senses. INFJs often think about the future rather than focusing on the here and now, and they're usually more interested in ideas and possibilities than in concrete details.

Feeling (F): INFJs prioritize their emotions and values when making decisions. They are often empathetic and sensitive to others' feelings, and they strive for harmony in their relationships.

Judging (J): This trait suggests a preference for structure and organization. INFJs like to plan and prefer order and predictability in their lives.

INFJs are known for their strong sense of idealism and morality. They are often passionate about advocating for causes they believe in and seek to make the world a better place. They tend to be creative, insightful, and compassionate, often showing a deep concern for people and social issues. However, they can also be sensitive and private, sometimes needing time away from others to recharge.

This personality type is considered to be rare, making up a small percentage of the population. INFJs are often drawn to careers in counseling, education, healthcare, or other areas where they can help others and make a meaningful impact.
