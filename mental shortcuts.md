The psychology problem surrounding the **28 - 2 vs. 28 + 2** scenario is often framed as a way to observe cognitive biases or mental shortcuts. It demonstrates how our expectations or assumptions can lead to incorrect reasoning.

### Problem Overview:
In the common example:
- A clerk mistakenly performs subtraction \( 28 - 2 = 26 \) instead of addition \( 28 + 2 = 30 \).
- The focus is often on why the clerk made this mistake (e.g., distraction, miscommunication, or a mental block).

### Trick to Disprove the Error:
To catch or disprove such a mistake in a **clear, visual, and immediate way**, you can use a quick **arithmetic verification** technique:

1. **Break Down the Operation:**
   Use the distributive property to show the difference visually:
   - \( 28 - 2 = (30 - 2) - 2 = 26 \)
   - \( 28 + 2 = (30 - 2) + 4 = 30 \)

   By showing these operations explicitly, it highlights the calculation's discrepancy and reinforces the correct logic.

2. **Reframe Using Counters:**
   Imagine 28 counters (or coins) physically.
   - If you subtract 2, remove 2 counters → you have 26.
   - If you add 2, add 2 counters → you have 30.

   The physical representation eliminates ambiguity.

3. **Use a "Balance Scale" Mental Model:**
   Visualize a scale where \( 28 \) is the baseline:
   - Subtracting 2 makes the scale lighter (26).
   - Adding 2 makes the scale heavier (30).

   This highlights the directional difference in operations.

4. **Immediate Proof with Double Check:**
   Quickly compute:
   - \( 28 - 2 = 26 \) (Correct subtraction)
   - \( 28 + 2 = 30 \) (Correct addition)

   The explicit recalculation clarifies the clerical error and disproves the mix-up.

5. **Modulo Check (Optional for Advanced Audiences):**
   Use a modulo system to check consistency:
   - \( 28 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod } 2) \)
   - Subtracting 2: \( 26 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod } 2) \)
   - Adding 2: \( 30 \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod } 2) \)

   The parity remains the same but the results differ, exposing the miscalculation.

### Psychological Insight:
- The error often arises from **anchoring** (expecting subtraction) or a **cognitive slip**. For example, if the clerk had been performing several subtractions earlier, their brain might default to that operation.
- The trick lies in breaking this automatic association by **explicitly clarifying each step**.
