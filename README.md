# Both spinners and RGB lights can be effective visual stimuli in PsychoPy, depending on the purpose of your experiment. Here's a quick comparison and guidance on when to use each
---

### **Spinner**
A spinner is typically used to create circular motion, often with varying speed, direction, or patterns. It’s useful for:
- **Motion Perception Studies**: Examining sensitivity to rotational motion or direction.
- **Attention Studies**: Testing how people focus on moving stimuli.
- **Visual Fatigue or Adaptation**: Investigating effects of prolonged observation of motion.
- **Brain Activity Mapping**: Identifying areas of the brain involved in motion processing.

**How to Implement in PsychoPy:**
- Use the **ShapeStim** class to create a spinner.
- Rotate the shape using the `ori` attribute over frames.

Example:
```python
from psychopy import visual, core

win = visual.Window([800, 800])
spinner = visual.Polygon(win, edges=100, radius=0.2, fillColor='white', lineColor='white')

# Animate spinner
for frame in range(360):
    spinner.ori += 2  # Rotate by 2 degrees per frame
    spinner.draw()
    win.flip()

core.quit()
```

### **RGB Light**
An RGB light stimulus can be used for dynamic color transitions or static color displays. It’s useful for:
- **Color Perception Studies**: Examining response to different colors and transitions.
- **Emotional Response**: Testing the effects of colors on mood or behavior.
- **Signal Processing**: Associating colors with tasks or actions.
- **Brain Activity Mapping**: Observing how the brain processes color information.

**How to Implement in PsychoPy:**
- Use the **Rect** or **Circle** stimulus class.
- Dynamically change the `fillColor` attribute to modify the color.

Example:
```python
from psychopy import visual, core

win = visual.Window([800, 800])
rgb_light = visual.Rect(win, width=0.5, height=0.5, fillColor='red', lineColor='red')

# Animate RGB transitions
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
    rgb_light.fillColor = color
    for _ in range(60):  # Display each color for 60 frames
        rgb_light.draw()
        win.flip()

core.quit()
```

### **Key Considerations:**
- **Task Goals**: Use spinners for motion and movement studies, RGB lights for color-focused experiments.
- **Complexity**: Spinners may involve more complex manipulations like changing speed or orientation, while RGB lights focus on color transitions.
- **Participant Comfort**: Motion can cause dizziness in some individuals, while rapid color changes might be overwhelming for others.
