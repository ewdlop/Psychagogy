Triforce Method for Reading Speed: The presenter, a medical student, shares the Triforce method, comprising strategies to boost reading speed significantly.
Improving Baseline Reading Speed:
Eliminating Internal Monologue: Using tools like Speer to read words visually instead of hearing them in your head. This shift can increase reading speed by at least 50%.
Visual Tracker Usage: Using a pen or finger as a tracker to maintain a smooth, consistent reading pace. This method can further increase reading speed by about 100 words per minute.
Adopting a Reading Strategy (80/20 Rule):
Focus on Key Information: Identifying that 80% of the knowledge in non-fiction books comes from 20% of the content.
Application Example: In "Atomic Habits," the speaker illustrates speeding through less critical content and slowing down for key information.
Summarizing and Consolidating Information:
Summarization Practice: Summarizing each page in one or two lines to enhance comprehension and retention.
Action-Oriented Learning: Applying learnings from non-fiction books, like tracking habits after reading "Atomic Habits."
Behavioral Change as a Learning Indicator: Emphasizing that true learning involves changing behaviors based on new information.
Application Beyond Reading: The presenter also touches on applying efficiency techniques to other skills, like typing.
Insights Based on Numbers:
Reading Speed Increase: The speaker went from 250 words per minute to over 500, indicating a significant improvement in reading efficiency.
Efficiency of Visual Tracking: The use of a visual tracker can increase reading speed by approximately 100 words per minute.
80/20 Rule in Reading: This principle highlights that a majority of valuable content in non-fiction books is often concentrated in a smaller portion of the text.
