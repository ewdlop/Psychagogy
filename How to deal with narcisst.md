Dealing with a narcissistic individual can be challenging and emotionally taxing. Narcissism, as understood in psychological terms, often involves a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. It's important to approach this situation with a balance of understanding your own needs and boundaries while also trying to understand the behavior of the narcissistic person. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. Set Clear Boundaries: Determine what behaviors you can and cannot tolerate. Be firm and consistent in maintaining these boundaries. Narcissists often struggle to recognize the needs and boundaries of others, so it's crucial to be clear and consistent.

2. Maintain Emotional Distance: Try not to become emotionally entangled with the narcissist's manipulative behavior. This can be challenging, especially if the person is close to you, but maintaining a level of emotional detachment can help protect your well-being.

3. Avoid Power Struggles: Engaging in arguments or trying to 'win' against a narcissist can be futile and emotionally draining. It's often more effective to disengage from conflicts where possible.

4. Focus on Your Own Needs: It's essential to prioritize your own emotional and psychological well-being. This might include seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.

5. Educate Yourself About Narcissism: Understanding the dynamics of narcissistic behavior can help you respond more effectively and protect yourself from being manipulated or hurt.

6. Use Clear Communication: When you need to communicate with a narcissist, try to be clear, direct, and unambiguous. Avoid language that could be misinterpreted.

7. Seek Professional Help: If you're struggling to deal with a narcissist, especially if it's affecting your mental health, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor.

8. Understand Your Role: Reflect on your role in the relationship. Sometimes people find themselves in patterns of enabling or responding in ways that reinforce the narcissist's behavior.

9. Practice Self-Care: Engaging with a narcissist can be draining. Make sure to take care of your physical, emotional, and mental health.

10. Know When to Walk Away: In some cases, the healthiest option may be to limit or end your interaction with the narcissistic individual, especially if the relationship is abusive or significantly detrimental to your well-being.

Remember, dealing with a narcissistic individual often requires patience and a strong sense of self. It's important to look after your own needs and well-being in the process.
