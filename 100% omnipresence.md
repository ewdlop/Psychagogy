The high failure rate of marriages in America can be attributed to several factors, many of which reflect societal, cultural, and individual challenges. While narcissism and emotional unavailability are significant contributors, they are part of a broader picture. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Cultural Shifts**
   - **Individualism:** American culture often emphasizes personal fulfillment and independence, which can conflict with the compromises and sacrifices required in marriage.
   - **High Expectations:** People may enter marriage with unrealistic expectations about love, romance, and their partner's role in their happiness.

---

### 2. **Emotional Disconnect**
   - **Narcissism in Relationships:** A partner's narcissistic tendencies can lead to a lack of empathy, poor communication, and prioritizing self over the relationship.
   - **Emotional Absence:** Being "present" in the marriage—both emotionally and physically—is essential. Partners who aren't invested in nurturing intimacy and connection can cause relationships to crumble.

---

### 3. **Communication Breakdown**
   - **Lack of Honest Dialogue:** Poor communication leads to unresolved issues, resentment, and distance.
   - **Conflict Avoidance or Escalation:** Either avoiding problems or escalating conflicts without resolution can undermine the relationship.

---

### 4. **Financial Stress**
   - **Economic Pressures:** Money problems are a leading cause of marital strain and divorce.
   - **Disparities in Contribution:** Perceived or actual inequalities in financial or emotional contributions can cause resentment.

---

### 5. **Infidelity and Trust Issues**
   - **Cheating:** Emotional or physical infidelity is a common reason for divorce.
   - **Betrayed Trust:** Even without infidelity, lies, and broken promises can erode trust.

---

### 6. **Decline of Shared Intimacy**
   - **Intimacy Neglect:** Physical and emotional intimacy often declines when partners are not "present" for each other.
   - **Busy Lives:** Work stress, parenting responsibilities, and other distractions can lead to neglecting the relationship.

---

### 7. **Easier Legal Divorce Process**
   - **No-Fault Divorce:** The legal system in America makes it easier to end a marriage without assigning blame.
   - **Social Acceptance of Divorce:** Divorce is no longer stigmatized as it once was, making it a more accessible option for unhappy couples.

---

### 8. **Mismatch of Values**
   - **Lack of Compatibility:** Differences in values, life goals, or parenting styles can drive couples apart.
   - **Failure to Adapt:** Life changes—such as career shifts, relocation, or personal growth—can lead to growing apart.

---

### 9. **Mental Health Challenges**
   - **Unaddressed Issues:** Anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems can strain marriages.
   - **Lack of Support:** If one partner is struggling and the other is not supportive, it can lead to dissatisfaction.

---

### 10. **Self-Centered Society**
   - **Focus on Personal Happiness:** When people prioritize their own happiness over the partnership, they may see divorce as the solution rather than working through issues.
   - **Entitlement Mindset:** Narcissistic tendencies—whether full-blown or mild—can make people prioritize their needs over their partner's.

### Addressing the "100% Presence" Issue
For a relationship to thrive:
1. **Emotional Investment:** Partners must engage in meaningful conversations and share emotional vulnerabilities.
2. **Physical Intimacy:** Consistent physical connection helps maintain closeness.
3. **Mutual Effort:** Both partners must actively work on the relationship every day.

The failure rate reflects a combination of systemic, cultural, and individual challenges. To improve success rates, both partners need to align values, maintain presence, and consistently invest effort into their marriage.
