Schizophrenia, initially termed dementia precox by Krepplin, is associated with a gradual cognitive decline.
This cognitive change is more persistent and resistant to treatment compared to symptoms like paranoia and hallucinations.
Cognitive issues in schizophrenia affect social functioning, employment, and independent living.
Efforts in cognitive rehabilitation focus on improving memory, planning, problem-solving, and flexibility in thinking.
Studies show promising but not outstanding results in cognitive remediation for schizophrenia, with limited availability of these programs.
