A covert narcissist is a subtype of narcissism where the narcissistic traits are not as overt or obvious as in the more familiar, grandiose form of narcissism. This type of narcissism is sometimes referred to as “vulnerable” or “closet” narcissism. Here are some key characteristics and behaviors associated with covert narcissism:

Key Characteristics of Covert Narcissism
Insecurity and Inferiority: Covert narcissists often harbor deep feelings of insecurity and inferiority. This can manifest as hypersensitivity to criticism and a constant need for reassurance.

Passive-Aggressiveness: Instead of the overt grandiosity and aggression seen in more typical forms of narcissism, covert narcissists may display passive-aggressive behaviors. They might make subtle digs or backhanded compliments, or employ silent treatment as a form of manipulation.

Quiet Self-Absorption: While overt narcissists openly seek attention and admiration, covert narcissists may appear shy or self-effacing. However, they are still primarily focused on themselves and their own needs.

Envy and Resentment: Covert narcissists often feel envious of others and may harbor a lot of resentment towards people they perceive as having more or being more successful than they are.

Victim Mentality: They frequently portray themselves as victims of circumstances or the actions of others. They may use their perceived victim status as a way to gain attention and sympathy.

Subtle Manipulation: Covert narcissists may manipulate people and situations to their advantage in less obvious ways. They might use guilt, feigned helplessness, or emotional withdrawal as tools to control or influence others.

Difficulty with Relationships: Covert narcissists often struggle with genuine emotional connections and intimacy. Their relationships can be tumultuous, with a tendency to blame others for relationship problems.

Differences from Overt Narcissism
Visibility: The grandiose narcissist is more easily identifiable with their overt demands for admiration and their more obvious self-centered behavior. In contrast, the covert narcissist’s traits are less apparent and may only be recognized in close relationships.
External Behavior: Covert narcissists may not exhibit the same level of outward confidence, assertiveness, or dominance typical of overt narcissism. They might instead seem reserved or withdrawn.
Importance of Professional Diagnosis
It's crucial to note that narcissism, whether covert or overt, is a complex personality trait, and in some cases, it can be a personality disorder. Only qualified mental health professionals can diagnose narcissistic personality disorder accurately. Understanding and dealing with narcissistic behavior, especially in close relationships, can be challenging and often requires professional guidance.
